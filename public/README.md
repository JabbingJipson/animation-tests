# Rive Files for Testing

This directory contains Rive (.riv) files for testing the Rive Asset Tester.

## How to add Rive files:

2. They will be available at `http://localhost:8080/filename.riv`
3. You can also upload files directly through the web interface

## Sample files:

- `sample.riv` - A basic sample animation (if available)
- Add your own Rive files here for testing

## Tips:

- Keep file sizes reasonable for web loading
- Test with different types of animations (state machines, timeline animations, etc.)
- Include files with various interaction triggers for comprehensive testing
